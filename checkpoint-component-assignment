####Questions
>Peruse the Official React documentation by Facebook, note down anything interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

* I think that once I get used to JSX I will appreciate it quite a bit. It's modular, more importantly the patterns are seemingly easily to follow.

>Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience building the component from scratch with your mentor.

* ```
function Greetings(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greetings name="Ashley" />
      <Greetings name="Andre" />
      <Greetings name="Katelyn" />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
