####Assignment

>In your own words, explain the essential differences between props and state in React. Which is immutable or read-only, and which changes? Discuss the answer with your mentor.

*  Props, which is shorthand for properties, are how components talk to eachother. Props are immutable, they represent constant data. State keeps track of mutable data, for example: user input.

>Read the React official documentation on components and props, and brush up on JavaScript ES6 *classes

>Built upon your component from the assignment after checkpoint 3, add in state and props to make sure you have fully mastered these core React properties.

class Greetings extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
  }


  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      number: 3
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <Greetings name="Ashley" />
      <Greetings name="Andre" />
      <Greetings name="Katelyn" />
      <p>Number of people: {this.state.number}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
